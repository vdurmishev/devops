This project uses Flask framework and SQLITE 3 relation database. 
This is a application with get request - gives all of the registered users names.
It also has post request to post new users.
You can run the application in any python IDE and access the local host link.
To access the users type "/users" in the end of the http link.
You can also run the application in Docker. To do so you have to build an Image with the docker build -t function.
After that you will see the image in your Docker Desktop client. You can find a picture of the app running in Docker below. ![image1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125134283/223151799-2545476b-fe6e-4a4c-92a3-92d19be84dfd.png)
